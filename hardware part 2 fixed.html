            <th>A monitor is a piece of computer hardware that displays the video and graphics information generated by a connected computer through the computer's video card.</th>
            <th>A computer mouse is a handheld hardware input device that controls a cursor in a GUI (graphical user interface) for pointing, moving, and selecting text, icons, files, and folders on your computer. In addition to these functions, a mouse can also be used to drag-and-drop objects and give you access to the right-click menu.</th>
            <th>A keyboard is one of the primary input devices used with a computer. Like an electric typewriter, a keyboard is composed of buttons to create letters, numbers, and symbols, and perform additional functions. The following sections provide more in-depth information and answers to frequently asked questions about the keyboard.</th>
            <th>Stands for "Central Processing Unit." The CPU is the primary component of a computer that processes instructions. It runs the operating system and applications, constantly receiving input from the user or active software programs. It processes the data and produces output, which may be stored by an application or displayed on the screen.</th>
            <th>The graphics processing unit, or GPU, has become one of the most important types of computing technology, both for personal and business computing. Designed for parallel processing, the GPU is used in a wide range of applications, including graphics and video rendering. Although theyâ€™re best known for their capabilities in gaming, GPUs are becoming more popular for use in creative production and artificial intelligence (AI).</th>
            <th>Random access memory (RAM) is the hardware in a computing device that provides temporary storage for the operating system (OS), software programs, and any other data in current use so they're quickly available to the device's processor. RAM is often referred to as a computer's main memory, as opposed to the processor cache or other memory types.</th>
